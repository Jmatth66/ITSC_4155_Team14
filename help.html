		<h2>Why can't I buy this feed / grain in this container? (Ex: Corn in a barrel)</h2>
            <p>Our mill isn't standardized across all of our bagging processes. What this means is
			some grains / feeds aren't setup to be put into certain containers. For example, we have 
			no easy way to fill a 2,000 lbs. sack of Oats. Additionally, select items like Sweet Feed
			can't go in containers like barrels. Sweet Feed in particular hardens overtime and would become difficult
			to get out.
            </p>	
		<br><hr><br>
		
		<h2>Do you offer discounts?</h2>
            <p>We do! All feed purchased in the following containers will come with a discount pre-applied:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Barrels</li>
				<li>Sacks</li>
				<li>Bulk</li>
			</ul>
			<p><i>("Bulk" refers to an order which is loaded directly onto a customer's 
			gravity cart or similar. This is availble by call / text only)
			</i></p>
			<br><hr><br>
			
		<h2>I placed an order online but received an email saying it was declined. Why?</h2>
            <p>This could be for any number of reasons. Low stock, time constraints, etc. 
			The email you received will always say exactly why your order was declined.
			This doesn't happen often. We do our best to make sure all orders are completed! 
            </p>	
		<br><hr><br>
		
		<h2>I can’t select the exact amount of the item I want!</h2>
            <p>Every order takes up a set amount of space, space that we are limited on. So 
			we don’t allow orders of less than 10 bags total. In the case that you want less 
			than 10 total bags you don’t need to place an order. Just come walk-in and grab 
			what you need! (Additionally we can't accept unrealistically massive orders).
            </p>	
		<br><hr><br>
		
		<h2>I left something at the mill! Can you hold onto it?</h2>
            <p>Absolutely, in fact this happens every now and then. Sometimes people leave their
			wallet, sunglasses, hat, etc. If it happens just call or text us. We'll
			find it and hold onto it until you can pick it up.
            </p>	
		<br><hr><br>
		
		<h2>How do orders with barrels work, and what's this "surcharge"?</h2>
            <p>Every barrel included in your order adds a surcharge of $50. However, you can
			exchange previously purchased barrels to waive this surcharge. This means you'll
			only need to pay for the barrels you need once, and then just exchange every time
			afterwards. And no, you cannot use your own store-bought barrels unless they are 
			exactly like ours.(Check the orders page to see what a barrel should look like. 
			For reference, they're best known as pickle barrels).
            </p>	
		<br><hr><br>
		
		<h2>I ran out of feed and need my order done immediantly! Can you squeeze me in?</h2>
            <p>Normally we do not take same day orders. Our work day is planned out each morning
			so we won't have time to add something else midway. If you absolutely need your order
			done today then call or text us. But please make an effort to not have that happen again.
            </p>	
		<br><hr><br>
		
		<h2>Can my order be delivered?</h2>
            <p>It depends, we do deliver but they must be manually accepted by the owner. All 
			deliveries are done locally by our own employees and company vehicles. For obvious 
			reasons, we can only deliver orders up to a certain distance. If you’d like to request 
			a delivery order then please call / text us.
            </p>	
		<br><hr><br>
		
		<h2>When will my order be ready?</h2>
            <p>Due to the sporadic influx of orders and the occasional massive order, it is difficult 
			for us to allow customers to select their own pickup date. Orders are all processed as 
			they are received. Once you place your order you should receive an email back within one 
			day letting you know when it will be ready. You’ll have one week after the given date to 
			receive your order, afterwards it will be removed and sold to another customer.
            </p>	
		<br><hr><br>
		
		<h2>I called / texted in an order over a week ago. Why isn't it ready?</h2>
            <p>Orders placed via call / text sometimes get lost, although only rarely. If this happens
			then call / text back and ask what happened. Typically the order is done but the owner forgot
			to let you know. (Online orders are setup to ensure this never happens!)
            </p>	
		<br><hr><br>
		
		<h2>What are your operating hours, and what time can I pickup an order?</h2>
            <p>Our operating hours go as follows:</p>	
			<ul>
				<li>Monday - Saturday: 8am-12pm, 1pm-6pm</li>
				<li>Monday - Saturday: 12pm-1pm Gone for lunch</li>
				<li>Sunday: Closed all day</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Walk-in customers are allowed to show up at anytime and get what they need.
			If you're picking up an order then you'll need to come within the listed hours.
			Some orders (such as bags) can be loaded manually outside of these hours. If you 
			want to do this then that's fine. However, other orders (barrels, sacks, pallets) 
			require help from us to load during the listed hours.
			</p>
